#Week9

This week we continue to review. Some topics that we cover;

 - Code blocks; we use code blocks between "{ }" brackets.
 - when we assign pointer to array pointer keeps first element of the array address.
 - Overloaded functions and when we use them.
 - typeof and typeid built-in functions. We use them to detect type of variables.
 - type info library helps us to recognize what type of object, variable or function that we use in our code.
 - result of "sizeof" function is the total amount of bytes.

 This weeks knowledge helps you to write dynamic functions and objects.
